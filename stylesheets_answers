1. The "cascading" in CSS refers to how we start at a broad level with our styling rules, but as we move down and "cascade", we begin to generate more and more specific rules for our HTML. 

2. The H1 could be showing black in any of these scenarios:
  - There is a embedded stylesheet in the html that defines h1 with a black font color
  - There is a more specific reference to h1 in the CSS e.g. a reference to the parent class of the #main div
  - Someone used an !important for the .alt class to make the font black.
